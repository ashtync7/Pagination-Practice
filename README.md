# Pagination-Practice
About the project:

Prerequisites:
    -- install npm 
    -- install mongoose

1. Set up pagination:
    -- Add seed data to populate and test 
    -- Set up schema in Users.js 

2. Implemented a middleware function (paginatedResults) that will paginate all endpoints in multiples of 5
    -- Established parameters, page (what page the data is showm on) and limit (how many datapoints are shown on a page)
    -- If statements for "next" (to show the next set of data) or "previous" page (to show the previous set of data)

3. Connected paginated API to MonogoDB for database storage
